# What is it?

I have developed a full fledged Face Detector application in python which aims to detect faces in any Image or detect any faces in a video file, also aims to detect faces appearing in your WebCam. Its created by the use of OpenCV in python which detect faces on a basis of a Haar Cascade file that contain all the face features.


# Requirments

Python 3 - version 3.7.0

## modules :

                  cv2 -> required for openCV
                  time -> required for sleep the time
                  os -> required for handling console features
                  sys -> required for system exit
                  msvcrt -> required for user input

# OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence itâ€™s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 14 million. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.
